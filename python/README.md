# Python Libraries

### keras vs pytorch vs tensorflow

**Keras** is a high-level deep learning API meant to be very user-friendly and so that the code would also be very interchangeable among the different systems. It was born within the group of the projects referred to as the TensorFlow but can also work in the conjunction with the Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK).

[**TensorFlow](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-tensorflow/)** deep learning library is developed by the Google Brain engineering team. It was open source licensed on the 2015 and has since then become very popular for its flexibility and also scalability. In essence, it is employed to roll out of the [**deep learning architectures**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-deep-learning/). It provides the whole range of a stable of toolkits, many libraries, and also includes the community assistance. The main benefit of TensorFlow is in the accessibility advantages and being deployable on the diverse platforms like CPUs, GPUs, TPUs, and even on the mobile devices. 

Facebook's AI Research team made [**PyTorch**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/getting-started-with-pytorch/), which has gained recognition for putting the things straightforward and also flexible. It was basically launched as an Open-Source Library for the purpose of training the deep learning algorithms in 2016. It is often applauded for its simplicity and also flexibility, which serves as a very powerful tool for the engineers whenever they want to do Debug and also experiment with some of the algorithms. PyTorch provides the most convenient integration with the [**Python**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-programming-language/) and allows the utilization of [**GPU acceleration**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-gpu-acceleration/). It's imperative programming allows for much closer and also much more fluid causal relationships and thus the model building and the debugging becomes much easier.

| **Parameter** | **Keras** | **TensorFlow** | **PyTorch** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Performance and Speed** | The constrain imposed by the moderate accomplishments with building bricks standardization. | In contrast, the graphics processing unit is optimized for running the many graph-based calculations. | Increased speed with operate the dynamic graph command is very important. |
| **Ease of Use and Learning Curve** | User-friendly interface | Steep learning curve | Simple to use, the glove provides many real-time graph relation growing. |
| **Community and Ecosystem** | Integrated ecosystem with TensorFlow | A robust community consensus and also adequate documentation concerning cybersecurity role should be provided. | The community's expansion on the base of the research is the key. |
| **Deployment and Production Readiness** | Gliding through the transition process from the prototyping into the deployment is an assurance for the success. | Ease of use and also enlarged capabilities with the accurate tools and also also rich libraries. | Inferior to TF in terms of the availability for the deployment purposes. |

### spaCY

spaCy is a free, open-source Python library that provides advanced capabilities to **conduct natural language processing (NLP) on large volumes of text at high speed**. It helps you build models and production applications that can underpin document analysis, chatbot capabilities, and all other forms of text analysis.

### ONNX, ONNX runtime

[Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX)](https://onnx.ai/) is an open ecosystem that empowers AI developers to choose the right tools as their project evolves. ONNX provides an open source format for AI models, both deep learning and traditional ML. It defines an extensible computation graph model, as well as definitions of built-in operators and standard data types.

**ONNX Runtime is a cross-platform inference and training machine-learning accelerator**.

**ONNX Runtime inference** can enable faster customer experiences and lower costs, supporting models from deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch and TensorFlow/Keras as well as classical machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn, LightGBM, XGBoost, etc. ONNX Runtime is compatible with different hardware, drivers, and operating systems, and provides optimal performance by leveraging hardware accelerators where applicable alongside graph optimizations and transforms.

### spaCY vs NLTK

Developers use spaCy to implement functions efficiently. The library is therefore less of a tool and more of a service. It is particularly suitable for production environments such as app development. NLTK, on the other hand, allows developers to choose from a wide range of algorithms for a problem and easily extend the library modules. NLTK thus enables developers to work as flexibly as possible. The library is therefore primarily aimed at scientists and researchers who want to develop models from scratch.

### DGL

DGL is an easy-to-use, high performance and scalable Python package for deep learning on graphs. DGL is framework agnostic, meaning if a deep graph model is a component of an end-to-end application, the rest of the logics can be implemented in any major frameworks, such as PyTorch, Apache MXNet or TensorFlow.

### CuPy

CuPy is a NumPy/SciPy-compatible array library for GPU-accelerated computing with Python. CuPy acts as a [drop-in replacement](https://docs.cupy.dev/en/stable/reference/comparison.html) to run existing NumPy/SciPy code on NVIDIA CUDA or AMD ROCm platforms.
